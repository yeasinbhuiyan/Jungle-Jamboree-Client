### welcome to my jungle jamboree site 



- First I created Header and Navbar and again I used Ami Condition on Navbar if there is Login then My Toys Route will show and if not then My Toys will not show on Navbar 

- Then we made the Banner. The Banner was made with Carousel and written on one side



- Then I made a Gallery Collection in the Home Section and made a Grid System with some pictures in the Gallery collection



- After that I made the Adorable Animals Toy Section, here I showed the pictures dynamically with Marquee




- Then I gave some information about our website in the Learn About Section and on the other side I used Animation with pictures



- Then when I go to All Toys Section, I have shown all the toys of the user in a dynamic way, there I have shown some information about the Toys in Table Format, then when I go to View details of each Toys, I can go to the details about that Toy.




- Then I am working on Authentication, after that I have made Login, Registration Form and then I have made Private Route



- After that, I created Add Toy Form, if we add to the form, then my toys will be shown in My toys and All Toys will also be shown.



- Then we did the work of React Tabs, we added Subcategory Add whatever name we added and filtered it by that name and showed it in Tabs.


- Then I did AOS Animation and did a lot of design for the website and also used Transformation in many ways.
