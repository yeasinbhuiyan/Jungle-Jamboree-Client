                    <p>Access Token An access token is a credential used for authentication and authorization purposes in web and mobile applications.
                        A refresh token is a credential used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to reauthenticate. It is typically issued alongside an access token during the authentication process.

                            <p> <span className='font-bold'>SQL: </span>
                                SQL databases follow a rigid, predefined schema structure based on tables, rows, and columns. They enforce data consistency and integrity through predefined relationships and constraints.
                            </p>

                            <p className='mt-3'> <span className='font-bold'>NoSQL: </span>
                                NoSQL databases offer flexible and dynamic data models. They can be document-based, key-value pairs, column-oriented, or graph-based, allowing for schema-less and unstructured data storage.

                            <p> <span className='font-bold'>SQL: </span>
                                SQL databases use SQL as the standard query language for performing operations such as data retrieval, manipulation, and management. SQL offers powerful declarative querying capabilities with standardized syntax.                      </p>


                            <p className='mt-3'> <span className='font-bold'>NoSQL: </span>
                                NoSQL databases often have their own query languages or APIs specific to their data models. These languages may be less standardized but offer flexibility for querying and working with the data model.                      </p>

                            <p> <span className='font-bold'>SQL: </span>
                                SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased workload by upgrading hardware resources of a single server. Scaling horizontally across multiple servers can be complex.                      </p>



                            <p className='mt-3'> <span className='font-bold'>NoSQL: </span>
                                NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing them to handle large-scale distributed systems efficiently. They can distribute data across multiple servers, enabling seamless scaling as demand grows.                      </p>

                            <p> <span className='font-bold'>SQL: </span>
                                SQL databases require a predefined schema, meaning the structure of the data must be defined in advance. Altering the schema can be time-consuming and may require migrating existing data.                      </p>


                            <p className='mt-3'> <span className='font-bold'>NoSQL: </span>
                                NoSQL databases offer schema flexibility, allowing for dynamic and evolving data structures. Changes to the data model can be made without downtime or complex migrations.                      </p>
